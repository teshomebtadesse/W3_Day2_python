#Practice creating Python programs to perform arithmetic and string, experimenting with variables, and exploring data types.

#Basic Calculator Program

#Create a simple Python program that asks the user to input two numbers and a mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
#Perform the operation based on the user's input and print the result.
#Example: If a user inputs 10, 5, and +, your program should display 10 + 5 = 15.

numb1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
numb2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

print("The sum is: ", numb1 + numb2)
print("The difference is: ", numb1 - numb2)
print("The product is: ", numb1 * numb2)
print("The quotient is: ", numb1 // numb2)

print("That's Great!")
